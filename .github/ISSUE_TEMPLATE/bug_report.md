# Please provide the followings things IN ORDER:

Before reporting a bug you need to make sure that the Bot has the right permissions to function properly, i highly suggest you clone the repository and try to replicate the bug, in theory you should get a detailed error in console, especially the ones from the ErrorHandler.

**Bug reporting:**

- Command name where the bug happened
- What happened after you typed the command
- Screenshot of the error (Bot's response on Discord)
- List of Bot's permissions in the channel
- If in possession, a screenshot of the detailed error log
